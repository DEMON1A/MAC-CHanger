//* This Tool is Auto Change MAC Address of the inter face without enter the normal command
i will show you the idea of this tool and how it works *//

Commands:
1: ifconfig
>> It Show you The Interfaces You Have In Linux if you open the script you can see on line
44 i use subprocess for send a command to a termenal and make "shell=True" to show the
interfaces on the termenal and you will see the change in MAC address after i send other
commands to termenal for change MAC address.

2: ifconfig down
>> OK this is used to make interfaces down B.C we can not change the MAC address when it 
was up and if you open the script contentyou will see i send this command to termenal with
subprocess in line 35 and change the MAC address after that.

3: ifconfig hw ether + Mac-address
>> This command is used to change the MAC address from the first MAC address to another MAC
Address You can enter any MAC like "00:11:22:33:44:55" but MAC Address should be 12 numbers
only so if you inter more/less than that it will show you an error.
